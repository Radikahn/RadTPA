Welcome to RadTPA Github page! This is an open source TPA modification for Minecraft 1.20.1 on Forge 47.3.0

This mod was made due to the lack of viable teleport mods on the market for MC Forge. This lightweight mod allows players to teleport to each other using the command line in MC. 
Commands include:

/radtpa <Player> **Teleports the command host to the player selected as a target**

/radtphere <Player> **Teleports player selected as target to the command host**

In order to prevent players from unwantedly being teleported to another player via the /radtphere command, an additional UI is avaible when pressing "." that allows you to turn on and off your TpHere availability. 
This will prompt other players that attempt to teleport you to them with a message that you have TpHere commands blocked.


The mod is currently being approved on CurseForge so the link for that download will be posted shortly...
